# Developer Notes:

This was programmed using Visual Studio Code and the [Comment Anchors](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ExodiusStudios.comment-anchors) extension to add developer notes to the codebase.

The default settings come with anchors for the following tags:

ANCHOR - Used to indicate a section in your file
TODO - An item that is awaiting completion
FIXME - An item that requires a bugfix
STUB - Used for generated default snippets
NOTE - An important note for a specific code section
REVIEW - An item that requires additional review
SECTION - Used to define a region (See 'Hierarchical anchors')
LINK - Used to link to a file that can be opened within the editor (See 'Link Anchors')
